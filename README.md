# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning. It uses a dataset containing various health metrics and applies a machine learning model to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health data. The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Deployment (optional)

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Heart Disease UCI Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 14 attributes, including:

- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
- **Cp**: Chest pain type (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic)
- **Trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- **Chol**: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl)
- **Fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
- **Restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results
- **Thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **Exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **Slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- **Ca**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- **Thal**: Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect)
- **Target**: Presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the dataset:**
   - Place the dataset (`heart.csv`) in the `data/` directory.

---

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing
Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:
```bash
python src/preprocess.py
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To visualize the dataset and analyze trends, run:
```bash
python src/eda.py
```

### Model Training
Train the machine learning model using:
```bash
python src/train.py
```

### Prediction
To make predictions on new data, use:
```bash
python src/predict.py
```

---

## Model Training

The project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** for prediction. The training process includes:
1. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Training the model on the training set.
3. Evaluating the model on the testing set.

To train the model, run:
```bash
python src/train.py
```

---

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positives among predicted positives.
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positives among actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

To view the evaluation results, check the output of `train.py` or run:
```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```
